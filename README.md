<h1 align = "center">Hello thereðŸ‘‹, I'm Eldad Monyl</h1>
- I am an upcoming programming student, fiercely passionate about technology and ready to dive in. While I couldn't pursue my tech aspirations in high school, I am now grabbing this opportunity with both hands.
My goal is to specialize in Cybersecurity and web development fields that are not only rapidly evolving but are also crucial in today's digital world. In Cybersecurity, I aim to tackle challenges like protecting systems from breaches, mitigating cyber threats, and ensuring data integrity and privacy. On the web development front, I am dedicated to creating dynamic, user-friendly websites, mastering front-end and back-end development, and continually pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible on the web.

I am rigorously exploring various programming and web scripting languages to build a robust foundation and stay ahead of the curve.
