Hello there. My name is Eldad Monyl and I am an upcoming programming student, eager and ready to learn. 
I have always been fascinated and passionate about technology, although I did not have the chance to pursue it while I was in high school. 
Now that I have the opportunity, I am determined to seize it and make the most of it.

I am aspiring to specialize in cybersecurity and web development, fields that are constantly growing and have become my passion. Currently, I am exploring various programming and web scripting languages to build a strong foundation in these areas.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at monyleldad@gmail.com or contact me at 0791689586.
